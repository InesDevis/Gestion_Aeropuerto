 In this REPO, all the information is detailed regarding the practical assign
ment for the Artificial Intelligence course. The simulation to be carried out is
 an airport management, which is a model designed as a decision-making tool for
 assessing various strategies with a focus on enhancing efficient airport actions.
 Specifically, this design addresses the challenges that may come from managing
 passenger flows within the airport terminals. It has been made different scenar
ios, in which all of them the model provide insights into how well prepared can
 it be when it comes to very crowded situation.
